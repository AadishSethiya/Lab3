# CS232-Lab3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Q1 (Capture the Flag!)
You are provided with 3 binary executables named as part_a, part_b, part_c. Use the objdump command to disassemble these executables, and read through them. 
* There is a function named part_a(int) which takes in an integer. You need to provide an integer such that the execution gives you a valid output. Any other input will result in termination.
* There is a function named part_b(int, int, int) which takes in three integers. You need to provide three integers such that the execution gives you a valid output. Any other input will result in termination.
* There is a function named part_c(char*) which takes in a string. You need to provide a string such that the execution gives you a valid output. Any other input will result in termination.

In README.md, provide clear insights on how you read through the assembly code, and how you discovered the implementation details. Finally, print the following string:
{part 1’s output} + {part 2’s output} + {part 3’s output}, where + denotes concatenation.

## Q2 (Find the inverse modulo m)
Write an assembly program using MIPS ISA to sort an array of numbers using In-place merge sort


## Q3 (Merge sort with a twist!)

## Q4 (The curious case of Matrix Multiplication)
